### OVERVIEW OF VISUALIZATION:

   1) KPIs are placed at the top of the dashboard, to easily view the figures associated with 'Total Complaints', 'Timely Response', 'Complaints In Progress', 'Disputed Rate' and 'Resolved at No Cost'.

   2) Complaints are segmented by 'Issue', 'States', 'Media', 'Product'. For States, a ‚Äòhex map‚Äô is used, for Media, a ‚ÄòLollipop‚Äô chart is used.

   3) A ‚ÄòDonut‚Äô Chart is used to show the percentage of disputed customers.

   4) I received inspiration for the 'Hex Tile Maps' from 'Sir Viz-a-lot' blogs by "Matt Chambers, MBA".

## Insight Gained:

    ‚Ä¢ 75,513 - Total number of Complaints were recovered. ¬¨
   
    ‚Ä¢ 98.05% of responses by bank were delivered in time as shown by horizontal bar chart.
   
    ‚Ä¢ There were 283 complaints pending which, a minute 0.37% of the total Companies‚Äô response to Consumer. It implies that Bank is quick in handling cases majorly.
   
    ‚Ä¢ 84.52% of cases were resolved with NO monetary relief.
   
    ‚Ä¢ The Highest Number of Complaints wrt to Products/Services were found in as follows; o Credit Card ~ 19,176 (25.36%) o Checking or Saving Account ~ 13,436(17.79%) o Mortgage ~ 12,470 (16.51%)
   
    ‚Ä¢ There were 31,203 complaints in Customer Dispute Cases approximately 40% of the total. Whereas 50% of the complaints are in ‚ÄòNA‚Äô category. Here 2 Pie Chart were created and dual axis feature was used.
   
    ‚Ä¢ Almost 50% of the Complaints were submitted via Internet ie. Website, Portal, Mobile App etc.
   
    ‚Ä¢ Consumers‚Äô top issue was regarding ‚ÄòManaging an Account‚Äô, followed by Deposits & Withdrawal.
   
    ‚Ä¢ For complaints arising from different states, I created ‚Äòhex map‚Äô for better view. States with highest number of complaints was shown in darker shade. States with small number of complaints was shown in lighter shade. The intensity of shade from darker to lighter were used for corresponding number of complaints.
   
## Results

   1) I observed that from 2012 to 2021 total no of complaints filed are 75,513, out of 75,513 total response which are in progress is 283.

   2) Disputed complaints are 7,363.
